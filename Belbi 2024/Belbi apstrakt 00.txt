Title: Analysis of Protein Disorder Regions Based on PPI Network Structure and Sequence Attributes: A Case Study

Abstract:
In this study, we explore the prediction of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) utilizing the structure of Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks and sequence characteristics. Leveraging a weighted PPI network, where edge weights represent gene co-expression information between two proteins, we extracted attributes related to protein topological properties using the node2vec+ tool [REF]. Subsequently, we incorporated attributes derived from primary sequence information, focusing on amino acid properties such as order/disorder promotion (A attributes) and physicochemical properties including aromaticity, polarity, and hydrophobicity (B attributes) [REF]. We conducted protein classification into IDP and non-IDP categories using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier [REF] in three scenarios: (1) solely based on network attributes, (2) incorporating network attributes and sequence Type A attributes, and (3) considering network attributes along with both sequence Type A and Type B attributes. However, some proteins misclassified as IDPs in all three scenarios were further examined. Through the application of the IUPred2 tool [REF], it was revealed that some of these proteins indeed possess disordered regions along their sequences. Notably, this study is conducted as a case study using the PPI network model of the yeast organism from BioGRID database [REF], with the list of yeast IDP proteins sourced from the DisProt database [REF], while information about gene co-experssion is obtained by SPELL tool [REF].
